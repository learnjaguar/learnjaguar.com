  <h3>What are Jaguars?</h3>
<p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'>Jaguars are the only large cat native to the Americas and the world's third largest after tigers and lions.
   Leopards, which dwell in Africa and Asia, have spots that are 
   similar to jaguars', although jaguars'spots are more 
   complicated and often include a dot in the centre.
   Many ancient South American tribes revered these ferocious cats as 
   gods, and images of the jaguar may be found in pre-Columbian art
    and archaeology from all throughout the jaguar's habitat.</p>

  <h3>Diet and Behaviour</h3>
  <p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'>Jaguars, unlike many other cats, do not shun water. They are, 
    in fact, excellent swimmers. They hunt fish, turtles, and even 
    caimans, piercing the creatures' skulls with their very powerful
     jaws. Jaguars also prey on deer, peccaries, capybaras, tapirs, 
     and a variety of other land animals, which they prefer to catch
      by surprise at night. </p>

    <p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'>Jaguars are solitary and territorial, marking their territors
       with their excrement or clawing trees.</p>
    
    <p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'>Females bear one to four pups, who are blind and defenceless when
     they are born. The mother stays with them and ferociously defends
      them from any animal that comes close, including their own father.
       Young jaguars learn to hunt by spending two years or more with
        their moms.</p>

   <h3>Range and habitat</h3>  
  <p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'> Jaguars used to be found all throughout the world, from central Argentina to the southern 
   United States. They've lost more than half of their land since the 1880s. Their current 
   stronghold is the Amazon Basin, while they can still be found in lower numbers in Central
    America.They live in tropical rainforests, although they can also be found in savannas 
    and grasslands.</p>

    <h3>Threats to survival</h3>
<p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'>Jaguars are threatened by a variety of factors, including habitat fragmentation and illicit hunting. The high rates of deforestation in South and Central America—for grazing land, agriculture, 
  and other purposes—have not only destroyed but also fragmented jaguar
   habitat. Cats are caged into patches of forest by fragmented woods, 
   and they can't go far to locate new partners. Inbreeding and local 
   extinctions can result from such isolation.
 
   Ranchers' retaliatory kills are another menace to jaguars. 
  Jaguars are more likely to hunt livestock as pasture land replaces 
  forests. Cattle owners shoot jaguars in response — and sometimes 
  in anticipation.
  
  Another growing issue for jaguars is poaching.
   Jaguars have always been targeted for their pelts,
    and now there is a growing illegal international traffic in
     jaguar teeth and bone items
   headed for China.</p>

<h3>Conservation</h3>
<p style = "color: #1c1c1b" style ='font-size:30px'>The International Union 
  for Conservation of Nature considers jaguars to be near-threatened. CITES, 
  a worldwide treaty that controls cross-border wildlife trafficking,
   has banned trading in its components, and the species has national 
   protection in practically every country where it is found. Poaching 
  and illegal trading persist, thus law enforcement needs to be strengthened.

  Support and development of jaguar corridors to connect scattered populations,
   as well as collaboration with ranchers to prevent human-jaguar conflict, 
   are significant initiatives. Ranchers can learn better husbandry skills by 
   attending workshops, and a growing number of programmes pay ranchers who lose 
   livestock to jaguars, making them less likely to kill the cat in revenge.

   Combating deforestation, which is being undertaken by a number of international
    NGOs and indigenous communities, is crucial.</p>
